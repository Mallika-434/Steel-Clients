# Customer Behavior Analysis & Prediction in Steel Procurement

## Overview
The **Customer Behavior Analysis & Prediction in Steel Procurement** project focuses on analyzing client interactions within an online steel procurement system. Using machine learning and deep learning models, it predicts purchase trends and optimizes customer conversion strategies.

## Features

### 1. Data Processing & Visualization
- **Dataset Analysis**: Preprocess and clean customer interaction data.
- **Statistical Insights**: Explore data distributions and key metrics using Pandas and NumPy.
- **Visualizations**: Generate insightful plots using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

### 2. Machine Learning & Deep Learning Models
- **Predictive Modeling**: Implement logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting, and support vector machines.
- **Deep Learning Integration**: Utilize neural networks to enhance prediction accuracy.
- **Model Evaluation**: Use cross-validation, accuracy scores, and confusion matrices to measure performance.

### 3. Client Behavior Classification
- **Customer Segmentation**: Classify users into Browsers, Selectors, Quote-only, and Buyers.
- **Behavioral Insights**: Predict which clients are likely to convert into Buyers.
- **Optimization Strategies**: Provide data-driven recommendations to improve customer engagement.

## Dataset Used
- **STEELMANUF_CLIENTS_SV.xlsx**: Contains client interaction data for the steel procurement system.

## Prerequisites
To run the analysis locally, you need:
1. Python 3.7+
2. Required Python libraries:
   - `pandas`
   - `numpy`
   - `matplotlib`
   - `seaborn`
   - `scikit-learn`
   - `tensorflow` (for deep learning)
   - `scipy`

## File Details
1. `Steel_Clients.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing data processing and model implementation.
2. `requirements.txt`: Lists all necessary dependencies.
3. `STEELMANUF_CLIENTS_SV.xlsx`: Dataset used for training and analysis.

## Running the Project Locally
1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Install required dependencies using `pip`:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook to explore and train models:
